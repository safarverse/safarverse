    <h2>Meet the heart behind safarverse</h2>
    <p>Every great travel company begins with a spark of wanderlust — and Safarverse is no different.
Behind this universe of travel stands our founder, Preeti Baseta, a passionate explorer and meticulous planner with an unshakable love for crafting unforgettable journeys.

Her story began like that of many travellers — full of excitement, yet challenged by the realities of travel, especially for women. From seeking permissions and managing safety to balancing schedules and budgets, the path to adventure was rarely simple. But instead of letting these hurdles stop her, Preeti found ways to make travel easier and more enjoyable — not just for herself, but for everyone around her.

Her attention to detail and love for exploration soon caught everyone’s eye. Whenever she shared photos or stories from her trips, people would ask, “Who organized this trip?” or “Which platform did you book it from?” — never realizing that every detail had been planned by her.

With each journey, her passion and confidence grew — and so did her vision. She realized that travel wasn’t just about exploring new places; it was about creating experiences that felt effortless, inclusive, and full of joy.

And that’s how Safarverse was born — not from a business plan, but from a genuine desire to make travel simpler, safer, and more meaningful for everyone. What started as one woman’s love for adventure has blossomed into a universe built on connection, discovery, and unforgettable memories.</p>
